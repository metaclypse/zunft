Die Zunft
#########

'Die Zunft' is a life simulation game that plays in the late middle age, when cities became powerful and even wealthy
peasants were able to secure power and a good life for themselves. The game is a clone of the masterpiece 'Die Gilde'
that was developed by JoWood Entertainment. (Note: It is not a clone of the Gold version of the game, but the original
version 1.0.)

The player assumes the role of a master craftsman who just opened his/her shop in the city.

The game is being played in rounds, whereas each round represents a day and also a season. The player starts in spring.
After 10 minutes nights falls and the player goes to bed, which marks the end of the round. The next day it is summer
and so on. During each round the player has to try his best to acquire wealth, extend his business and to gain friends
and influence in the city. Depending on their profession, there are different ways to pursue this goal. The following
section gives an overview of the available professions.


Professions
###########
There are 11 possible professions, however, only 9 are available at the beginning of a match. The last 2 (robber and
merchant) can only be switched to mid-game. The following list shows, what each profession does:

Blacksmith: The blacksmith is a craftsman and creates metal objects, which he sells.
Alchemist: The alchemist creates potions with various effects, that can help the player in-game or be sold.
Perfumer: The perfumer creates perfumes and concoctions that he sells. The difference to the alchemist is that
the effects of perfumes are more centered around humans and their relationships.
Priest: The priest takes care of the local church and collects money from the peasants. However, he can also write and
sell scriptures.
Guard: The guard is in charge of upholding order in the city. He can patrol the streets and perform raids on suspects,
where he keeps a share of the confiscated loot.
Thief: Thieves earn money by robbing buildings and pickpocketing.
Mason: The mason is a craftsman that creates and sells stone objects.
Carpenter: Another craftsman, the carpenter creates items made of wood.
Host: The host leads an inn, where he brews alcohol, cooks meals and supplies space for gambling.
Robber: The player can only change to robber mid-game. Robbers reside in old ruined castles and rob the transport
carts that roam the city.
Merchant: The player can only change to merchant mid-game. Merchants loan money and trade rare foreign goods.


Starting Conditions
###################
At the beginning of the game the player chooses one of these professions. Once the game starts he/she then starts
with the following means:
* 1 shop where he/she performs his craft; the kind of the shop depends on the chosen profession
* 1 employee in the shop
* fixed amount of money as starting capital, the currency depends on the city
* 1 house where the player resides
* a certain amount of materials in the shop's stock which can be used to craft a few initial items


Crafting Items
##############
Item creation is performed by employees. See the respective section for more details.


Buying and Selling
##################
There are 2 ways of buying and selling items: On the central marketplace of the city or in the respective shop.
The player starts by producing some items. To sell them, he can simply leave them in his shop's stockpile. Here and
there, other characters of the city automatically come and buy one or two items from the stock. However, this is not
predictable and provides no steady income, therefore the player must also sell goods on the marketplace.
Every city has a central marketplace where each item can be sold or bought. For this purpose, the items have to be
transported from the shop to the marketplace, which is done by a transport cart.


Prices
######
Prices for goods are varying, they change all the time throughout the game. Even during one round/day the prices
fluctuate, so the player must observe the local market and sell and buy goods at the best possible time.


Carts
#####
Each business uses transport carts to transport items to and from the marketplace or other shops. There are three types
of carts:
* small cart: operated by a driver, only has 1 item slot, slow, cheap (500)
* big cart: operated by a driver, has 2 item slots, slightly faster, moderate price (1000)
* horse cart: operated by a driver and a horse, has 3 item slots, fastest, expensive (1500)


Buildings
#########
Buildings are necessary for persons to live in and to perform their professions. There are also city-owned buildings
that serve no direct purpose for the player or other persons.
As building types/levels become available, they can also be built directly, without building cheaper buildings first
and then upgrading.


Houses
######
Houses are the buildings in which players and other persons reside. They can be improved with various extensions and
additional rooms. Houses can also be upgraded. Upgrades are available according to a person's standing in the city.
The player starts with the lowest standing and thus the cheapest possible house. Differences between the types of
houses are: size, price, available extensions and rooms.
Each house starts with an office, where other rooms can be added.

The house types are as follows:
1) House: 1 room possible
2) Citizen House: 2 rooms possible
3) Mansion
4) Palazzo


Shops
#####
Shops, in general, are buildings where the persons perform their business.


Employees
#########
The player does not create items or perform duties himself. Instead, he/she has employees that are used to perform work
like forging, cooking, crafting and so on. Depending on the size of the business, the player can employ a certain
amount of people. They usually start as apprentices and can be promoted to bachelor.
