A 2D clone of the game "Europa 1400: The Guild"

This project aims to create a game that plays exactly like "Europa 1400: The Guild". It is therefore meant to be a middle-age trade and life simulation which plays a little bit like a board game.

The player assumes the role of a person who moved to a middle-age city and just finished learning a specific job. Now he/she must create items, trade with them and upgrade their house or workshop. Another aspect of the game is to socialize with fellow citizens and to try to gain power in the city by being elected into powerful positions.

The game is intended to be a full clone, except for the graphics. For reasons of personal taste and ability, I will not try to recreate the 3D look of the game, but instead try to use 2D graphics.
